# TODO

* 2D diagram of tag SNP effectiveness by genetic distance and allele frequency
  mismatch

# Sources of samples

* GaP registry

# Genome-wide association studies

## Using indication-relevant endophenotypes as traits

Examples:

* Common variants associated with risk for thyroid cancer were identified using
  an initial GWAS on circulating TSH levels [@Gudmundsson2012a].

### Mendelian randomization to test endophenotype-associated variants for disease of interest

## Reproducibility across studies

## Genetic architecture

# Exome sequencing of cases and controls

* Feasible if cohort size is large enough, but cost will be prohibitive.
* Barcode and pool samples prior to exome capture and sequencing.
* Can detect uncommon and rare variants of large effect e.g. OR > 10, as well 
  as common variants of lesser effect, though the latter would also be found 
  by SNP GWAS.

# deCODE approach - imputed WGS

* Reasons for success: Test rare (causal) variants directly, use large sample
  sizes, lower background genetic variation in Iceland, possibility of using
  family-based statistical genetics.
* deCODE's approach is to impute uncommon and rare variants from whole genome
  sequencing into chip-typed individuals and from there into their relatives.
  The advantages are (i) querying uncommon alleles increasing the likelihood of
  finding a large effect, (ii) use of disease-relevant endo-phenotype, (iii)
  large sample size through the use of imputation and quantitative
  endophenotypes, (iv) selection of traits with high heritability (confirmed in
  the Icelandic population using their genealogy database), and likely (v)
  reporting those GWAS on those traits for which a suitable genetic architecture
  (high effect size alleles of sufficient frequency) happened to exist in the
  Icelandic population (deCODE tests 1500 traits against all available imputed
  variants).
* Requires cohort comprised of related individuals for long-range phasing. Does
  not require the degree of relatedness to be known i.e. genealogy is not
  required. But for any given individual, a number of genotyped relatives must
  be identifiable. See Kong et al 2008 Nature Genetics.
* What is the distribution of relatedness within a sample of US individuals?
  What cohort size is required for long-range phasing? 10% of population or
  36,000? Likely much more since US population is heterogenous with large and
  continued migration.
* "According to Stefansson, Iceland is one of the world's most genetically
  homogenous nations. To put it bluntly, Icelanders -- because there are so few
  of them -- are more likely to have children with somebody that they are
  related to."
  ^[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/26/iceland-genealogy-database_n_1032621.html]
* As of early 2012, deCODE has published studies [@Gudmundsson2012a;
  @Sulem2011; @Rafnar2011] that conduct genotype imputation using:
    * whole genome sequence data from 457 Icelanders, each sequenced to an
      average depth of 10x.
    * whole genome SNP genotypes of 41,675 Icelanders, imputed into their
      relatives.

    I estimate that this restricts their observation to alleles of at
    least 0.5% - 1% frequency (i.e. observed in atleast 2 individuals each
    sequenced at 10X) or to a subset of alleles of at least 0.2% frequency which
    were observed in only one of the 457 samples but with high confidence.

In a GWAS of BCC (basal cell carcinoma) conducted by deCODE using two-way
imputation (rare variants imputed into SNP genotyped individuals using
long-range phasing and then into non-genotyped indivuduals using genealogy), the
strongest signal from studying 2121 cases (of 4265 in Iceland) and nearly 40,000
controls was a variant in the 3' UTR of TP53 with odds ratio 2.36, p-value 5.2 ×
10^-17^ and 2% allele frequency. The best on-chip tag SNP, which was in moderate
linkage disequilibrium with the above SNP (r^2^ = 0.15), had a much weaker
signal with odds ratio 1.18, p-value 2.4 × 10^-3^ and 12% allele frequency.

For imputed genotypes, deCODE estimates the *effective* sample size from the
trend between sample size and variance of parameter estimates in regression
models. Presumably, the effective sample size is used where appropriate in place
of the count of imputed genotypes.

For validation or follow-up studies, deCODE has focused on loci instead of
variants, which is appropriate since the same variants may not be sufficiently
frequent in a population distinct from that used in the discovery study.

## deCODE questions

* Read deCODE proposal
* How often do you find significant associations with large effects? For
  disease status and for endophenotypes?
* Can we include CNV, indels and SV in the two-way imputation for GWAS?
* Effect of phenotyping error on power
* What proportion of variants of 0.1% are captured? of causal variants are captured?


# Sequencing small numbers of unrelated sporadic cases with rare/extreme phenotypes

* Idiopathic Multicartic Osteolysis
* Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis
* Brown Adipose Tissue defect (Kevin Corbit, http://www.sciencemag.org/content/suppl/2011/10/05/science.1210878.DC1/Hussain.SOM.pdf)
* Number of individuals needed vs. penetrance/phenotype severity vs. candidate gene/exome/whole genome scan

# Mapping in kindreds

* Dominant/recessive (with [autozygous/homozygous] or without consanguinity [allozygous/compound homozygous])
* Single or multiple kindreds/sibships/singletons
* Homozygosity mapping in single individuals

# Family-based linkage/association studies

* Neuropathic pain (Stefan McDonough) - heritability, GWAS had low power,
  partner with Brigham and Women's/Partner's HealthCare and Mass. General Hosp.
  which has 4M patients with electronic medical records that can be queried to 
  find cases with diabetic neuropathy and idiopathic neuropathy for genotyping
* Schizophrenia: high heritability, low proportion explained by GWAS
    * Collaboration with Lynn DeLisi on affected sib-pair study of SCZ
    * Find structural variants e.g. VIPR2/VPAC CNVs with large effect size
    * Stratify by type of SCZ
    * Collaboration with Bill Byersley on 400 linkage-mapped public kindreds in
      NIHM collection (need to be a registered PI to access data).  Bill also 
      has DNA from 4000 cases and 4000 controls for follow-up of genes 
      identified from kindreds, by testing whether these have a higher frequency
      of variants in the case-control study.
* Consider recommendations of Lander et al for LOD scores/p-values/Z-scores
* How sensitive are linkage and IBD results to misclassification of phenotype? 
  To reduced penetrance or increased phenocopy?

# Affected sib-pair
* See http://www.jbrf.org/research/sibling.html
* See http://www.jmp.com/support/downloads/life_sciences_documentation/PR_G_GN_0040.html
* See http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/users/terry/Classes/s260.1998/Week6/week6/week6.html

## Extremely discordant- and concordant sib pairs
* See EDAC at linkage.rockefeller.edu/soft

# TDT in trios

# Homozygosity mapping in consanguinous families

# GWAS curation

* GWAS followed by limited WGS and imputation cannot identify rare variants, 
  only somewhat rarer variants due to the r2 requirements of GWAS (Wray)

* T2D
* CVD - CAD, HF
* Chronic kidney disease

# Simulation study

### EcMap 

* Does simulation consider centromere-linkage i.e. interference?
* The simulation randomizes child genotypes given parent genotypes. What is the
  source of the parent genotypes and can they be randomized? Would this make a
  difference?
* Does the simulation randomize causal variant site (locus)?
* Is randomizing conditional on family structure and affection status
  appropriate? How does this alter the distribution of kindred genotypes and
  mapping outcomes?
* Can the software simulate X-linkage?
* Useful metrics: Bayes probability crossing point/point at which
  P(causal)/P(random) = 3/P(causal|20cM), total length of causal and random IBD
  regions
