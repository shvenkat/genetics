# Kinship

The kinship coefficient $\Phi_{ij}$, is the probability, for any given locus,
that an allele picked randomly from one individual $i$ is identical by descent
with an allele picked randomly from another individual $j$ [@Helgason2008] .
This coefficient is formally defined as:

$$ \Phi_{ij} = \sum_{p=1}^{K} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\!n_p} (1 + f_{A_p}) $$

where $K$ is the total number of independent paths from common ancestors in the
pedigree linking individuals $i$ and $j$, $n_p$ is the number of steps in the
$p$-th path, and $f_{A_p}$ is the coefficient of inbreeding for the common
ancestor of the $p$-th path. The coefficient of inbreeding $f$ is calculated
using the same formula, such that $f_i$ is equal to $\Phi$ for the parents of
individual $i$. These calculations can be performed using a recursive algorithm.

Note: The two definitions above differ by a factor of two, with the formula
yielding a higher value, which is also consistent with the coefficient of
relationship^[See <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_relationship>].

# Physical map distance, genetic map distance and recombination frequency

In general, genetic map distances between loci are additive, while
recombination frequencies are not. At small map distances however, recombination
frequencies are approximately additive. In other words, given three distinct
loci $a$, $b$ and $c$ in chromosomal order, we have:

$$ d(a,c) = d(a,b) + d(b,c) $$

and

\begin{align*}
\Pr(R_{a,c}) & = \Pr(R_{a,b} \cap \overline{R}_{b,c})
               + \Pr(R_{b,c} \cap \overline{R}_{a,b}) \\
             & = \Pr(R_{a,b}) + \Pr(R_{b,c}) - 2\Pr(R_{a,b} \cap R_{b,c}) \\
             & < \Pr(R_{a,b}) + \Pr(R_{b,c})
\end{align*}

using the following notation:

$d(x,y)$
  ~ is the genetic distance between loci $x$ and $y$
$R_{x,y}$
  ~ is the event of recombination between loci $x$ and $y$

## Map functions

The relationship between genetic distance and recombination frequency varies by
species and sex. The  Map functions *model*

# IBD sharing

Consider two individuals who are $n$th-degree cousins separated by $2(n + 1)$
meioses^[Note that $n>0$; $n=0$ does not represent the case of full siblings.].
Their chance of sharing a given locus IBD is $2^{-2n}$, which decreases rapidly
with increasing $n$. Given that they do share a locus IBD, they are expected to
also share a region around this locus that is on average $200/(2n + 2)$
centiMorgans (cM) in genetic length. Notably, this length deceases more
gradually with $n$. For instance, if $n$ is 9, the likelihood of sharing any
given locus IBD is 0.000004, and the shared region is on average 10 cM in length 
[@Kong2008].

## Estimation of the probability of sharing a locus IBD

$n$-th degree cousins have 2 common ancestors in the $(n+1)$-th preceding
generation. At any given locus, they can share at most one of the four alleles
present in the common ancestors, each with a probability of $2^{-2(n+1)}$. Hence
the probability of sharing any allele at a given locus IBD is $4 \times
2^{-2(n+1)} = 2^{-2n}$.

## Estimation of the length of an IBD region

Given that two $n$-th degree cousins, separated by $2(n + 1)$ meioses, share a
locus IBD, the distribution and the mean of the length of the shared region
around this locus can be estimated as follows. I use the following notation and
relationships:

$l$
  ~ the genetic length of the shared region around the IBD locus in Morgans
$d$
  ~ the genetic distance from the IBD locus to one end of the shared region
$c(x)$
  ~ the number of crossovers between two loci $x$ Morgans apart in a single 
    meiosis
$R_x$
  ~ the event of recombination between two loci $x$ Morgans apart in a single 
    meiosis
$\theta(x)$
  ~ the recombination fraction between two loci $x$ Morgans apartevent of recombination between two loci $x$ Morgans apart in a single 
    meiosis

Assuming a miniscule and fixed probability of a crossover occurring at any
given locus (i.e. ignoring crossover interference and recombination hotspots),
$c_x$ has a binomial distribution that can be well approximated by a Poisson
distribution with parameter $\lambda = x$ (Haldane map function). The
probability of recombination between two loci separated by a genetic distance of
x Morgans is $(1-e^{-2x})/2$.

\begin{align*}
\Pr(R_x) 
  &= \Pr(c_x is odd) \\
  &= \sum_{k=0}^\infty \Pr(c_x = 2k+1)
\end{align*}

\begin{displaymath} c_{x,1} = \frac{1-e^{-2x}}{2} \quad \end{displaymath}

Then:

\begin{align*}
\Pr(d^{IBD} > x) &= \Pr(\overline{R}_x)^{2(n+1)} && \text{ignoring recombination hotspots} \\
  &= \left( \frac{1+e^{-2x}}{2} \right)^{2(n+1)} && \text{see above} \\
  &= 
\end{align*}

\newcommand{\dd}{\, \mathrm{d}}
\begin{align*}
\text{E}[l^{IBD}] &= 2 \, \text{E}[d^{IBD}] && \text{ignoring crossover interference} \\
  &= 2 \, \int_0^\infty \! x \Pr(d^{IBD} = x) \dd x \\
  &= 2 \, \int_0^\infty \! x \dd (\Pr(d^{IBD} \leq x)) \\
  &= 2 \, \int_0^\infty \! x \dd (1 - \Pr(d^{IBD} > x)) \\
  &= 2 \, \int_0^\infty \! x \dd (1 - \Pr(\overline{R}_x)^{2(n+1)}) && \text{ignoring recombination hotspots} \\
  &= 2 \, \int_0^\infty \! x \dd (1 - (1 + e^{-2x})/2)^{2(n+1)}) \\
  &= 2 \, \int_0^\infty \! x \dd (1 - (\Pr(r_{x,1} = 0))^{2(n+1)}) && \text{ignoring recombination hotspots} \\
  &= 2 \, \int_0^\infty \! x \dd (1 - (1 - \Pr(r_{x,1} > 0))^{2(n+1)}) \\
%  |(1-x)^{2n+2} dx \\
%  &= (2n+2) \int_0^\infty x (1-x)^{2n+1} dx \\
%  &= (2n+2) \cdot \text{B}(2, 2n+2) \\
%  &= (2n+2) \frac{1!(2n+1)!}{(2n+3)!} \\
  &= 1/(2n+3)
\end{align*}
